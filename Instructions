Instructions:

1. Create a free Azure Account (in case you don't have one available)
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/offers/ms-azr-0044p/
In case you want to use another cloud provider, feel free to do it
Note: for Azure, you will have available 170€ (if a remember correctly) of free Azure credits. You will need to introduce a debit/credit card, but no charghes will be applied until you get over 170€ of expenses
Remember to delete that account so Microsoft won't charge anything in your bank account

2. Create a service connection(in Azure DevOps portal, https://dev.azure.com/ ) so you can deploy resources from Azure Devops to Azure portal(https://portal.azure.com)
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml

3. Clone the repository https://github.com/AleksAlonso/RocheDevOpsAssessment.git (ask for permissions on the repo first with a GitHub account)

4. Open RocheDevOpsAssessment.sln
	4.a Make it compile
	4.b Make all Unit tests green
	
5. You should push the changes to your own repository in Azure Devops, not to the github acccount
	5.a Use GitFlow branching strategy
	5.b Add a build policy in the PR (When the pipeline is ready is ready, see 6)
	5.c Follow best practiques
	
6. Make use of IaC to create the resources needed in Azure (just a Webapp).
	6.a Use ARM templates
	6.b Use Terraform
	
6. Create a pipeline(YAML preferred, but old UI pipelines are also accepted) that is able to:
	6.a Build the application
	6.b Release the infrastructure with both approaches (ARM and terraform)
	6.b Release the application in any cloud provider
	
7. Build a powershell script that is able to:
	7.a Weather Forecast
	7.b Show the results in the pipeline
	
	
9. When everything is ready and deployed in Azure, make sure all UI tests in the VS solution are working by:
	
	9.a Modify the UI tests so they run against your brand new cloud environment
	9b. Selenium tests are green
